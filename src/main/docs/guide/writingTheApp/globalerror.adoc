We want to display a custom `Not Found` page when the user attempts to access a uri for which we have not any route defined for.

The views module provides support for view rendering on the server side and does so by rendering views on the I/O thread pool in order to avoid blocking the Netty event loop.

To use the view rendering features described in this section, add the following dependency on your classpath. For example, in build.gradle

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=views,indent=0]
----

Micronaut ships out-of-the-box with support for http://velocity.apache.org/[Apache Velocity], https://www.thymeleaf.org/[Thymeleaf] or http://jknack.github.io/handlebars.java/[Handlebars]. In this guide, we use Apache Velocity.

Create a `notFound.vm` view:

[source,html]
.src/main/resources/views/notFound.vm
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/resources/views/notFound.vm[]
----

Create a `NotFoundController`:

[source,java]
.src/main/java/example/micronaut/NotFoundController.java
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/java/example/micronaut/NotFoundController.java[]
----

<1> The class is defined as a controller with the `@Controller` annotation.
<2> Inject an available https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/api/index.html[ViewRenderer] bean to render an HTML view.
<3> The Error declares which `HttpStatus` error code to handle (in this case 404). We declare the method as a global error handler due to `global = true`.
<4> If the request `Accept` HTTP Header contains `text/html`, we respond an HTML View.
<5> By default, we respond JSON.
